Little game with painful sound effects and an original gameplay based on MIDI music pieces
This game is a 2D "puzzle" platformer.

The idea here is to create a real gameplay with MIDI files. At startup, file is charged and permits to "procedurally" generate level. Each time you jump on a platform, it emits the sound of the note from which it was generated. Moreover, the gameplay includes bonuses that totally changes how you have to play it. For instance, certain bonuses will permit to use only one specific weapon, anothers will not allow to use any weapon and you will have to dodge every single enemy. Game is just a "prototype", and is supposed to be far better played with sound activated.
